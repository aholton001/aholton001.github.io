		<p><h1>This semester I am taking Web Development at Tufts and in the process of
			learning new skills like HTML and JavaScript. I wrote all of the pages for my github website in HTML and implemented some JavaScript concepts in the examples below. Enjoy!</h1></p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-aholton/responsive/">
			Here</a> is an example of using responsive design and a sprite sheet. When this webpage is open and the web browsers pixel width increases or decreases, the image will change. All of the images are taken from a single image which I used a spriting technique on.</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-aholton/mspacman/">
			This</a> is an example of using the canvas API in javascript and spriting an image. I used the sprite image that google used for their pacman game and first laid down the gameboard and then ms.pacman.</p>
		<p>Lastly, <a target="_blank" href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-aholton/mmap">
			this</a> is the last class project I worked on. It uses uses javascript to find your location and sends your location to a data store. Once your location is recieved, the data store will return the locations of other students in Web Development and their distance away from you.</p>
