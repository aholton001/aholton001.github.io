			<p>Hey everyone, my name is Amoses Ezekiel Holton and my name is pronounced Aye-Moses, or maybe it's Ah-Moses. Never really asked my parents but I've always gone by Moses anyhow. I was born in Detroit, but I grew up in Minnesota. Now I live in Boston and am currently a Junior at <span class="jumbo">Tufts University</span>. I am studying a unique major offered at <span class="jumbo">Tufts University</span> called Cognitive and Brain Science which has three main focuses: Psychology, Philosphy and Computer Science. Because of this major I found the love of my life, Computer Science. Thank you <span class="jumbo">Tufts University!</span></p>
